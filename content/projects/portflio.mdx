# 🚧 How I Built My Portfolio

This portfolio was a hands-on learning project where I combined multiple modern frontend technologies to showcase my work and personal brand. I built it using **Next.js 13**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MDX**, ensuring it’s both **beautiful** and **performance-optimized**.

## 🎯 Goal

My goal was to create a clean, responsive site that:

- Reflects my skills as a frontend and full-stack developer  
- Is optimized for performance and SEO  
- Supports dynamic content via MDX  
- Is enjoyable to build and maintain
