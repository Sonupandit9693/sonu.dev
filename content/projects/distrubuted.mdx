**Distributed Python Microservices with Kubernetes** is a fully containerized and scalable microservices architecture built using **Python (FastAPI)** and orchestrated with **Kubernetes**. The system includes core services like authentication, API gateway, async messaging with RabbitMQ, and file storage using MongoDB GridFS.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔐 **Auth Service** – JWT-based user authentication
- 🌐 **API Gateway** – Centralized routing for services
- 📨 **RabbitMQ** – Event-driven asynchronous communication
- 🗄 **MongoDB & GridFS** – Document & file storage
- 🔄 **Interservice Communication** – HTTP and Event-based
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** – Scalable deployment using StatefulSet, Ingress

---

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sonupandit9693/distributed-python-k8s.git
cd distributed-python-k8s
```

### 2. Start with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Deploy to Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
