Smart File Vault is a full-stack file management platform built with React and Django. It uses advanced file deduplication to reduce storage use, and powerful filtering features for efficient file retrieval.

###### File Deduplication System  
Use SHA-256 hashing and reference counting to ensure duplicate files are never stored twice

###### Search & Filter  
Search by filename, filter by file type, size, and date — even combine filters for precision

###### Optimized Storage  
Get real-time stats on storage savings and deduplication efficiency

###### Modern Tech Stack  
React 18, Django 4, Docker, SQLite, Tailwind, and RESTful APIs — deployable with Docker Compose

###### Easy API Access  
REST API for uploading, listing, filtering, deleting files, and viewing storage metrics

###### Built for Developers  
Frontend & backend run separately or with Docker; includes `.env`, logging, and health checks

###### Try It Locally  
```bash
# Clone and run with Docker
git clone https://github.com/Sonupandit9693/smart-file-vault.git
cd smart-file-vault
docker-compose up --build
